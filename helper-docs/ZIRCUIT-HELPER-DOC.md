# Zircuit Staking Model Helper Documentation for LLM Development

This document provides a comprehensive guide for developing a staking model on Zircuit, an EVM-compatible zero-knowledge (ZK) rollup, based on the [Zircuit Documentation](https://docs.zircuit.com/) and related web resources. It is designed to assist an LLM in creating staking-related applications, covering setup, core features, staking mechanics, best practices, and example implementations.

## Overview of Zircuit

Zircuit is a Layer 2 blockchain network that combines a hybrid architecture of zero-knowledge rollups and optimistic rollups, fully compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It offers enhanced security, low-cost transactions, and high throughput, making it an ideal platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and staking programs. Zircuit’s staking model allows users to stake ETH, liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and liquid restaking tokens (LRTs) to earn rewards and Zircuit Points, contributing to network security and decentralization.

### Core Features of Zircuit Relevant to Staking

1. **Hybrid Architecture**
   - Combines Optimism’s Bedrock framework with zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) for scalability and security.
   - Built on battle-tested infrastructure (e.g., Optimism’s Bedrock, Halo 2, Geth).[](https://inesstavares.com/evm-compatible-zk-rollup-zircuit)
   - Enables efficient transaction processing and low fees.

2. **Sequencer-Level Security (SLS)**
   - Monitors the mempool to prevent malicious transactions at the sequencer level.
   - Enhances staking security by ensuring only valid transactions are included in blocks.[](https://www.gate.com/learn/articles/all-you-need-to-know-about-zircuit/5146)

3. **Secure Native Bridge**
   - Facilitates safe asset transfers between Ethereum (L1) and Zircuit (L2).
   - Critical for staking, as users may need to bridge ETH or tokens to Zircuit’s Liquidity Hub.[](https://www.bitrue.com/blog/exploring-zircuit-evm-compatible-zero-knowledge-rollup)

4. **Ethereum Compatibility**
   - Supports Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask) and tools (e.g., Hardhat).
   - Allows seamless deployment of Ethereum-based staking smart contracts.[](https://www.bitrue.com/blog/exploring-zircuit-evm-compatible-zero-knowledge-rollup)

5. **Zircuit Staking Program**
   - Users can stake ETH, LSTs (e.g., stETH), and LRTs to earn Zircuit Points and yield.
   - Offers flexibility with no mandatory lock-up periods, preserving liquidity.[](https://www.koinx.com/staking-guides/how-to-stake-zircuit)
   - Amassed over $129M in Total Value Locked (TVL) within 24 hours of launch.[](https://www.thestockdork.com/zircuit-new-zk-rollup-focused-on-security-launches-staking-program/)

6. **Tokenomics**
   - **ZRC Token**: Native token with a total supply of 10 billion.
   - Allocation relevant to staking:
     - Season 1 Airdrop: 7% (700M ZRC)
     - Future Airdrops & Community Rewards: 14% (1.4B ZRC)
     - Community Provisions: 12.61% (1.261B ZRC)
   - Zircuit Points earned through staking can be converted to ZRC tokens post-mainnet.[](https://www.bitrue.com/blog/exploring-zircuit-evm-compatible-zero-knowledge-rollup)[](https://www.gate.com/learn/articles/all-you-need-to-know-about-zircuit/5146)

## Getting Started with Zircuit Staking Model Development

### Prerequisites
- **Wallet**: An EVM-compatible wallet (e.g., MetaMask) with ETH for gas fees and staking.
- **ZRC Tokens**: Obtain ZRC tokens via exchanges like Gate.io or Binance for staking.[](https://www.koinx.com/staking-guides/how-to-stake-zircuit)
- **Development Tools**: Hardhat, Remix, or Foundry for smart contract development.
- **Node Provider**: Access to an Ethereum and Zircuit node (e.g., Chainstack, Alchemy).
- **Zircuit Documentation**: Refer to [docs.zircuit.com](https://docs.zircuit.com/) for API and contract details.

### Step 1: Set Up Development Environment
- **Action**: Configure your development environment for Zircuit.
- **Details**:
  - Install Hardhat or Foundry:
    ```bash
    npm install --save-dev hardhat
    ```
  - Configure Zircuit’s network settings in your development tool (e.g., `hardhat.config.js`).
    ```javascript
    module.exports = {
      networks: {
        zircuit: {
          url: "https://zircuit1-mainnet-api.zircuit.com", // Hypothetical RPC URL
          chainId: 48900, // Confirm with Zircuit docs
          accounts: [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY],
        },
      },
    };
    ```
- **LLM Tip**: Prompt the user for Zircuit’s RPC URL and chain ID from the official documentation if not provided.

### Step 2: Obtain ZRC Tokens
- **Action**: Purchase ZRC tokens on supported exchanges (e.g., Gate.io, Binance, HTX).[](https://www.koinx.com/staking-guides/how-to-stake-zircuit)
- **Details**:
  - Ensure the wallet is compatible with Zircuit (ERC-20 if ZRC is Ethereum-based).
  - Transfer tokens to the user’s wallet or bridge to Zircuit’s L2 network via the native bridge.
- **LLM Tip**: Warn users to double-check deposit addresses and network compatibility to avoid loss of funds.

### Step 3: Integrate with Zircuit’s Liquidity Hub
- **Action**: Connect to Zircuit’s Liquidity Hub for staking.
- **Details**:
  - Use Zircuit’s official staking platform for staking ETH, LSTs, or LRTs.
  - Access via smart contracts or the Liquidity Hub interface.
  - Example interaction with a staking contract (hypothetical):
    ```javascript
    const stakingContract = new ethers.Contract(
      STAKING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      STAKING_ABI,
      signer
    );
    const tx = await stakingContract.stakeZRC(amount, { gasLimit: 200000 });
    await tx.wait();
    console.log("Staked:", tx.hash);
    ```
- **LLM Tip**: Suggest checking [docs.zircuit.com](https://docs.zircuit.com/) for the staking contract address and ABI.

### Step 4: Develop Staking Smart Contract
- **Action**: Create a staking smart contract for custom staking logic.
- **Sample Contract** (Solidity):
  ```solidity
  // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
  pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

  import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/IERC20.sol";

  contract ZircuitStaking {
      IERC20 public zrcToken;
      mapping(address => uint256) public stakes;
      uint256 public totalStaked;

      constructor(address _zrcToken) {
          zrcToken = IERC20(_zrcToken);
      }

      function stake(uint256 amount) external {
          require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than 0");
          zrcToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
          stakes[msg.sender] += amount;
          totalStaked += amount;
      }

      function unstake(uint256 amount) external {
          require(stakes[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient stake");
          stakes[msg.sender] -= amount;
          totalStaked -= amount;
          zrcToken.transfer(msg.sender, amount);
      }

      function getStake(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
          return stakes[user];
      }
  }
  ```
- **LLM Tip**: Replace `_zrcToken` with the actual ZRC token address. Recommend adding reward distribution logic based on Zircuit Points or APR.

### Step 5: Test and Deploy
- **Action**:
  - Test the staking contract on Zircuit’s testnet (if available) or a local fork.
  - Deploy to Zircuit’s mainnet using Hardhat:
    ```bash
    npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network zircuit
    ```
- **LLM Tip**: Suggest auditing the contract for security vulnerabilities before deployment.

## Best Practices for Zircuit Staking Development

1. **Security**
   - Use audited libraries like OpenZeppelin for token interactions.
   - Implement checks for reentrancy and overflow vulnerabilities.
   - Leverage Zircuit’s SLS to monitor for malicious transactions.[](https://www.gate.com/learn/articles/all-you-need-to-know-about-zircuit/5146)

2. **Liquidity and Flexibility**
   - Design staking contracts with flexible lock-in periods or no lock-ups to align with Zircuit’s model.[](https://www.koinx.com/staking-guides/how-to-stake-zircuit)
   - Allow users to withdraw funds without penalties where possible.

3. **User Experience**
   - Provide clear UI feedback for staking status, rewards, and Zircuit Points.
   - Integrate with MetaMask or other wallets for seamless user interaction.

4. **Gas Optimization**
   - Minimize gas costs by batching transactions where possible.
   - Use Zircuit’s efficient proof aggregation for lower transaction fees.[](https://www.bitrue.com/blog/exploring-zircuit-evm-compatible-zero-knowledge-rollup)

5. **Compliance**
   - Ensure compliance with local regulations for staking and token rewards.
   - Use Zircuit’s audited smart contracts for staking to reduce risks.[](https://www.koinx.com/staking-guides/how-to-stake-zircuit)

## Example Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Staking ZRC for Rewards
- **Goal**: Allow users to stake ZRC tokens to earn Zircuit Points and yield.
- **Implementation**:
  - Deploy a staking contract to lock ZRC tokens.
  - Track user stakes and distribute rewards based on APR or Zircuit Points.
  - Example (extending the sample contract):
    ```solidity
    function distributeRewards(address user, uint256 reward) external {
        require(stakes[user] > 0, "No stake found");
        zrcToken.transfer(user, reward);
    }
    ```
- **LLM Tip**: Suggest integrating with Zircuit’s Liquidity Hub for official reward distribution.

### Use Case 2: Staking ETH with Gas Mining
- **Goal**: Enable users to stake ETH and earn 125% ZRC tokens per ETH spent on gas.[](https://www.bitrue.com/blog/exploring-zircuit-evm-compatible-zero-knowledge-rollup)
- **Implementation**:
  - Use the Liquidity Hub to stake ETH.
  - Track gas spent and calculate ZRC rewards.
  - Example API call (hypothetical):
    ```javascript
    const response = await fetch('https://api.zircuit.com/v1/stake', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        asset: 'ETH',
        amount: '1.0',
        wallet: userWallet,
      }),
    });
    const result = await response.json();
    console.log('Staked ETH, earned ZRC:', result.zrcEarned);
    ```
- **LLM Tip**: Verify the staking endpoint with Zircuit’s documentation.

### Use Case 3: Community Governance
- **Goal**: Allow staked ZRC holders to vote on protocol upgrades.
- **Implementation**:
  - Extend the staking contract with governance logic.
  - Example:
    ```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) public votes;
    function vote(address user, uint256 proposalId) external {
        require(stakes[user] > 0, "Must be a staker");
        votes[user] = proposalId;
    }
    ```
- **LLM Tip**: Suggest integrating with Zircuit’s community governance features for ZRC holders.[](https://www.koinx.com/staking-guides/how-to-stake-zircuit)

## Common Smart Contract Functions (Hypothetical)

| Function | Description | Parameters |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| `stake` | Stake ZRC tokens | `amount` |
| `unstake` | Withdraw staked tokens | `amount` |
| `getStake` | View user’s staked amount | `user` |
| `distributeRewards` | Distribute ZRC or points | `user`, `reward` |

- **LLM Tip**: Validate contract functions against Zircuit’s official staking contracts or Liquidity Hub API.
