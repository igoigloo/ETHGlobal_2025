Fern API Helper Documentation for LLM Development
This document provides a comprehensive guide for integrating and utilizing the Fern Developer API, based on the information from the Fern Developer API documentation. It is designed to assist an LLM in developing applications with the Fern API, covering setup, core features, best practices, and example use cases.
Overview of Fern API
Fern is a currency conversion and payments API that enables developers to integrate features such as onramps, offramps, foreign exchange (FX), cryptocurrency exchange, and wallet management into their applications. It connects with licensed liquidity providers and financial institutions to provide global currency support through a standardized API.
Core Features

Multiplex API

Supports any-to-any currency conversion for both cryptocurrency and fiat currencies.
Example: Convert USD to BTC, EUR to ETH, or any other supported pair.


Wallets API

Enables provisioning of wallets for users to facilitate onramping, offramping, and deposit management.
Ideal for applications requiring user-managed funds.


Multi-currency Virtual Accounts API

Provides named virtual accounts for businesses and individual customers.
Supports fiat acceptance in over 15 currencies.
Useful for applications needing multi-currency payment processing.


Fern Compliance Program

Offers branded KYC/B (Know Your Customer/Business) forms for global onboarding.
Managed by Fern’s internal compliance team to review customer applications.
Simplifies regulatory compliance for businesses.


Developer Experience

High-touch customer support.
Scalable API design focused on reliability and responsiveness.
Comprehensive documentation and SDKs (if available).



Getting Started with Fern API
The Fern API is currently in private beta. Follow these steps to begin development:
Step 1: Create a Developer Account

Action: Sign up at dashboard.fernhq.com.
Details:
Provide information about your use case (e.g., fintech app, crypto exchange, payment gateway).
Select a billing plan (e.g., Builder tier or other available tiers).


LLM Tip: When prompted for use case details, provide a concise description of the application’s purpose, such as “Building a crypto trading platform with USD-to-BTC conversion.”

Step 2: Pre-fund Your Billing Wallet (If Applicable)

Action:
For Builder tier subscribers, pre-fund your billing wallet with USDC to unlock specific API features like KYC or wallet creation.
For other tiers, pre-funding is optional; otherwise, Fern invoices monthly.


LLM Tip: If the application requires frequent KYC checks or wallet provisioning, recommend pre-funding to avoid delays. Query the user for their subscription tier if unclear.

Step 3: Set Up API Keys

Action:
Create API keys for different environments:
Sandbox: For testing (currently in development, coming soon).
Pre-production: For staging and validation.
Production: For live applications.


Access API keys via the Fern dashboard.


LLM Tip: Always recommend storing API keys securely (e.g., in environment variables or a secrets manager). Warn against hardcoding keys in source code.

Step 4: Start Building

Action: Begin integrating the Fern API into your application.
Resources:
Refer to the official Fern API documentation for endpoints, parameters, and examples.
Use SDKs or libraries (if provided) to simplify integration.


LLM Tip: Suggest starting with a simple API call (e.g., currency conversion) to verify setup before implementing complex features like wallet provisioning.

Best Practices for Fern API Development

Environment Management

Use the sandbox environment (once available) for testing to avoid unintended costs or live transactions.
Test API calls thoroughly in pre-production before deploying to production.


Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for API responses (e.g., rate limits, invalid requests, or insufficient wallet funds).
Log errors with timestamps and response codes for debugging.


Security

Secure API keys and avoid exposing them in client-side code.
Use HTTPS for all API requests to ensure data encryption.
Implement rate-limiting awareness to avoid exceeding API quotas.


Compliance

Leverage Fern’s compliance program for KYC/B to streamline user onboarding.
Ensure your application complies with local regulations for currency conversion and payments.


Scalability

Design your application to handle high transaction volumes, leveraging Fern’s scalable API.
Cache frequently accessed data (e.g., supported currency pairs) to reduce API calls.



Example Use Cases
Use Case 1: Currency Conversion for a Fintech App

Goal: Enable users to convert USD to BTC instantly.
Implementation:
Use the Multiplex API to fetch supported currency pairs.
Make a POST request to the conversion endpoint with parameters for source currency (USD), target currency (BTC), and amount.
Display the converted amount and transaction fee to the user.


Sample Pseudocode:const response = await fetch('https://api.fernhq.com/v1/convert', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${API_KEY}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    sourceCurrency: 'USD',
    targetCurrency: 'BTC',
    amount: 1000
  })
});
const result = await response.json();
console.log(`Converted ${result.amount} ${result.targetCurrency}`);



Use Case 2: User Wallet Provisioning

Goal: Create a wallet for a user to deposit and withdraw funds.
Implementation:
Use the Wallets API to provision a new wallet.
Store the wallet ID securely in your database.
Allow users to deposit funds via onramp and withdraw via offramp.


LLM Tip: Ensure the billing wallet is pre-funded for Builder tier users before provisioning wallets.

Use Case 3: Multi-currency Payment Gateway

Goal: Accept payments in multiple fiat currencies for an e-commerce platform.
Implementation:
Use the Multi-currency Virtual Accounts API to create named accounts for customers.
Configure the account to accept payments in 15+ currencies.
Use Fern’s compliance program to onboard customers with KYC/B forms.


LLM Tip: Recommend branding KYC forms with the company’s logo for a seamless user experience.

Common API Endpoints (Hypothetical)
Since specific endpoints are not provided in the documentation, here are hypothetical endpoints based on typical API patterns. Refer to the official Fern API documentation for actual endpoints.



Endpoint
Method
Description
Parameters



/v1/convert
POST
Convert between currencies
sourceCurrency, targetCurrency, amount


/v1/wallets
POST
Create a new user wallet
userId, currency


/v1/virtual-accounts
POST
Create a virtual account
accountName, currencyList


/v1/kyc
POST
Submit KYC/B form
userData, branding



LLM Tip: Always validate endpoint availability and parameters against the official documentation. If endpoints are unavailable, suggest contacting Fern support via the dashboard.

Troubleshooting

API Key Issues

Problem: Invalid or expired API key.
Solution: Generate a new key in the Fern dashboard and update your application.


Insufficient Funds

Problem: Billing wallet lacks funds for Builder tier features.
Solution: Pre-fund the wallet with USDC or check billing settings.


Rate Limits

Problem: API returns a 429 (Too Many Requests) error.
Solution: Implement exponential backoff and retry logic. Contact Fern support to discuss quota increases.


Compliance Delays

Problem: Slow KYC/B processing.
Solution: Ensure all required fields are complete. Contact Fern’s compliance team via the dashboard.

Notes for LLM

Context Retention: Store this helper document in memory for quick reference when assisting with Fern API-related queries.
Dynamic Updates: If the user provides additional Fern API details (e.g., specific endpoints), update this document with the same artifact_id to include new information.
User Queries: If the user asks for specific code examples, generate them based on the hypothetical endpoints above or prompt for clarification if actual endpoints are needed.
Privacy: Do not store or share sensitive information like API keys or user data outside the application context.
